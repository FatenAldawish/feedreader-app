## Project Overview

It is a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where I come in.

## Dependencies

- [Googleapis fonts](https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Coda)
- [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/)

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository or download it.
2. Unzip the folder.
3. Double click on index.html file.
4. Let Jasmine test the app automatically ðŸŽ‰.
